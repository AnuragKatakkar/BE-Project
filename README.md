# Virtual Sketch Artist Using Generative Adversarial Networks

## About

Virtual Sketch Artist is a platform which is designed to generate and identify images of faces of
perpetrators. Whenever a crime needs to be reported, the application is fed with text description of
the suspectâ€™s face provided by either the victim or any eyewitness. Images of faces are then
generated by the application using AttnGAN. The user then selects the most relevant pictures
generated by the system and then sends them to concerned authorities along with details such as
type of crime, incident information.
This makes a one-stop reporting place for crimes that take place and speeds the process of incident
report generation and identification of suspects which helps in better response to the exploited
victims.
